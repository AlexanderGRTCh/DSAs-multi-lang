DSAs Multi-Lang

This repository is a collection of simple and foundational data structures and algorithms written in Python, C++, and Java. Each implementation focuses on clarity and understanding, showing how the same logic looks and behaves across different languages.

The purpose is to build a clear base for mastering problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. It starts with core data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, and hash maps, then gradually expands into sorting, recursion, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.

Each file is short, readable, and fully commented, serving as both a learning guide and a quick reference when revising or preparing for interviews.

Languages covered
Python for clean, readable logic
C++ for performance and pointer control
Java for structure and object-oriented clarity

Main topics
Stack
Queue
Linked List
Hash Map
Binary Tree
Heap
Graph
Sorting and Searching
Recursion
Dynamic Programming

The goal is to make data structures feel intuitive and practical rather than academic, helping you understand the why behind each concept, not just the how.
